Glossary:
	* List: a data type that contains multiple values in an ordered sequence. Created with square brackets.
	* Tuple: similar to a list, but can't be modified once it's created. Created with regular brackets.
	* Reference: a value that "points to" something in the computer's memory.
	* Slicing: taking part of a list or string and creating a new list or string from it (a "slice")
	* Immutable: something that can't be changed once it's created.
	* Mutable: opposite of immutable, something that can be changed (mutated) after creation.
	* Method: like a function, but called directly on a value or variable by adding a dot and the method name on the end.
